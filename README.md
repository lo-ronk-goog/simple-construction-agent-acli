> 💡 **Tip:** Use [Gemini CLI](https://github.com/google-gemini/gemini-cli) for AI-assisted development - project context is pre-configured in `GEMINI.md`.

## Requirements

Before you begin, ensure you have:
- **uv**: Python package manager (used for all dependency management in this project) - [Install](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/) ([add packages](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/concepts/dependencies/) with `uv add <package>`)
- **agents-cli**: Agents CLI - Install with `uv tool install google-agents-cli`
- **Google Cloud SDK**: For GCP services - [Install](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/install)


## Quick Start

Install required packages:

```bash
agents-cli install
```

Test the agent with a local web server:

```bash
agents-cli playground
```

You can also use features from the [ADK](https://adk.dev/) CLI with `uv run adk`.

## 🛠️ Project Management

| Command | What It Does |
|---------|--------------|
| `agents-cli scaffold enhance` | Add CI/CD pipelines and Terraform infrastructure |
| `agents-cli infra cicd` | One-command setup of entire CI/CD pipeline + infrastructure |
| `agents-cli scaffold upgrade` | Auto-upgrade to latest version while preserving customizations |

## 🚀 CI/CD Pipeline

This project includes a custom CI/CD pipeline configured for GitHub Actions:

- **File**: `.github/workflows/ci.yml`
- **Environment**: Defined by the `Dockerfile` in the root directory. It installs `agents-cli` and handles dependencies like `litellm` in the cloud.
- **Triggers**:
  - **CI**: Runs on every Pull Request or push to `main`. It builds the container and runs agent evaluations.
  - **CD**: Triggers when you push a version tag (e.g., `v1.0.0`).

### How to use:
1.  Add your `GEMINI_API_KEY` to GitHub Secrets.
2.  Push code to see the CI run evaluations.
3.  Push a tag to trigger the deployment workflow.

---

## Development

Edit your agent logic in `app/agent.py` and test with `agents-cli playground` - it auto-reloads on save.

## Deployment

```bash
gcloud config set project <your-project-id>
agents-cli deploy
```

To add CI/CD and Terraform, run `agents-cli scaffold enhance`.
To set up your production infrastructure, run `agents-cli infra cicd`.

## Observability

Built-in telemetry exports to Cloud Trace, BigQuery, and Cloud Logging.
